## The offensive paradigm shift

The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into the digital landscape is not merely a productivity booster for legitimate businesses; it represents a major technological disruption for the cybercrime ecosystem. Until recently, cyberattacks were constrained by two main factors: the attacker's technical skill and available human time. AI removes both barriers simultaneously. We are witnessing a democratization of offensive capabilities, where low-skilled malicious actors can now deploy sophisticated attacks previously reserved for state-sponsored groups (APTs). This article analyzes how AI is fundamentally transforming the structure of digital threats.

## **Social Engineering in the era of LLMs: the end of the language barrier**

Phishing remains the most prevalent initial infection vector. Historically, defense against these attacks relied on detecting syntactic inconsistencies, spelling mistakes, or inappropriate tones. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has rendered this detection method obsolete.

Specific models derived from the Dark Web, such as WormGPT or FraudGPT, are trained without the ethical guardrails found in public actors like OpenAI. These tools allow attackers to generate Spear Phishing campaigns on an industrial scale. By ingesting stolen or public contextual data (LinkedIn profiles, annual corporate reports), AI drafts hyper-personalized emails, perfectly mimicking the writing style of an executive or a supplier. Furthermore, the native translation capabilities of these models allow foreign cybercriminal groups to operate in any language with native fluency, effectively removing traditional linguistic indicators of compromise.

## **Polymorphism and code mutation: the challenge to traditional antivirus**

On a purely technical level, AI is revolutionizing malware development. Traditional detection, often taught in IT curriculums, relies on viral signatures: a file's hash is compared against a database of known threats. If the hash matches, the file is blocked.

Generative AI now allows for the automation of malware polymorphism. An attacker can instruct an AI to rewrite the source code of a Ransomware or Infostealer for every new iteration. The AI modifies the syntactic structure, renames variables, inserts junk code, or changes the instruction order while keeping the payload functional. The result is a binary file with a unique digital footprint for every download. This capability saturates signature databases and renders classic antivirus software ineffective, forcing enterprises to migrate towards Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions based on behavioral and heuristic analysis rather than static analysis.

## **The biometric threat: deepfakes and vishing**

"CEO Fraud" is seeing an alarming resurgence due to advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and voice synthesis models (VALL-E, RVC). It is now technically possible to clone a target's voice from just a few seconds of audio, often extracted from phone calls, voicemails, or public videos.

This technique, known as AI-assisted Vishing (Voice Phishing), allows attackers to call an accounting department or an IT helpdesk while impersonating a decision-maker. Real-time voice synthesizers even allow for fluid conversation, mimicking the intonations and speech patterns of the usurped victim. This evolution breaks the implicit trust model based on voice recognition and forces organizations to drastically revise their human authentication procedures, making single-channel validation obsolete.

## **Defensive analysis and perspectives**

Faced with this "militarization" of AI, the cybersecurity posture must evolve from a perimeter protection logic towards a Zero Trust architecture. The sophistication of AI-generated lures implies that human error is inevitable: an employee will eventually click.

The technical response lies in the widespread adoption of phishing-resistant strong authentication, specifically hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn standards), which cannot be deceived by a fraudulent interface, however perfect it may be. In parallel, defense must also be automated. Only defensive AI, integrated into SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) solutions, is capable of processing the volume of alerts generated by these automated attacks and responding at machine speed. The asymmetric war of cybersecurity has entered a new phase: that of algorithmic confrontation.
