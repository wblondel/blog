Hello and welcome to my blog 😁

Ta-da! It's finally here! I've been putting off this moment for quite a while...

I have often thought that it would be a good idea to create a blog on which I would share my knowledge.

That's now a thing!

On this blog, you will find guides, tutorials, and various articles about web development, system administration, security, and genealogy. This way, my blog will also be my personal Wikipedia.

I started programming at a very young age on an [Amstrad CPC 6128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC), and fast forward to today, I am a full-stack web developer, with a preference for the PHP and Python ecosystems. I love [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)!

I've been soaking up the incredible vibes in the Philippines for almost 2 years now. Before this, I called both Malaysia and France home. While I'm not sure if it'll be on this same blog, I'm excited about sharing all the stories and experiences with you!

See you in the next post 😁!
